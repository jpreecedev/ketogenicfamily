    "Put mozzarella & cream cheese in a medium size microwaveable bowl",
    "Microwave for 1 min, stir and then another 30 sec, stir (very hot!)",
    "Stir in egg & almond flour",
    "Wet hands and spread “dough” thin on parchment paper. It should spread evenly with dough-like consistency (if “stringy” then your cheese has hardened too much—just put it back in the microwave for maybe another 20 seconds)",
    "Dock (poke rows of holes) with a fork to avoid bubbling",
    "Sprinkle with garlic salt",
    "Put in 425 degree oven.  After about 8 minutes, check it and poke holes where any large bubbles may be.",
    "Continue cooking for a total 12-14 min, or until slightly brown on top.",
    "Add a think layer of pizza sauce",
    "Add toppings to suit.  Our favourites are; cheese, chorizo, bacon, salami, pepperoni, onion.",
    "Put back in oven for 5 minutes or until golden brown"
