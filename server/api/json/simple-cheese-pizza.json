  "instructions": [
    "To make brazil & precan flour, blend both bags of nuts in a food processor and put this to one side.",
    "Put mozzarella & cream cheese in a medium size microwaveable bowl.",
    "Microwave for 1 min, stir and then another 30 sec, stir (very hot!)",
    "Stir in egg & flour.",
    "Wet hands and spread \"dough\" thin on parchment paper. It should spread evenly with dough-like consistency (if stringy then your cheese has hardened too much just put it back in the microwave for maybe another 20 seconds)",
    "Dock (poke rows of holes) with a fork to avoid bubbling.",
    "Sprinkle with garlic salt",
    "Put in 425 degree oven. After about 8 minutes, check it and poke holes where any large bubbles may be.",
    "Continue cooking for a total 12-14 min, or until slightly brown on top.",
    "Add the salsa for the sauce",
    "Add cheese slices for the topping",
    "Put back in oven for 5 minutes or until golden brown"
