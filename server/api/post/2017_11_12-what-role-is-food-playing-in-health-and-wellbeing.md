Your body is a complex organic machine with many moving parts.  Like a machine, your body needs a source of fuel to function.  Everything you consume, dietary food and drink, has a direct effect on your health.  When you consume food, a process takes place to break down and utilize the energy it brings.  This process, which starts with chewing, and continues with digestion, requires organs, muscles, enzymes, acids and hormones to work effectively.

Energy and nutrients from food are used to repair muscles, make your brain and other vital organs function, replace your skin regularly, and to fight off infectious illnesses and diseases.

Eating can also trigger the brain to release endorphins, the *feel good* chemical, which elevate your mood and make you feel happy.

## What exactly does the body need to function effectively?
When you consume food, it is broken down using water and acid in the stomach, a process known as digestion.  Broken down food passes to the small intestine, where nutrients are absorbed.

Your body needs an array of macro and micronutrients to function effectively, most of which can not be synthesized by the body directly so must be introduced through diet.  These
nutrients are called *"essential macro/micronutrients"*.  We will discuss this in more detail throughout this post.

## What are essential macro/micronutrients?
Essential macro/micronutrients can be divided in to groups as follows;

### Protein
Protein is used by the body to maintain muscle, organs, skin and hair.  Protein also plays an important role in the growth and development of enzymes, hormones, immunity, and cell repair.

Protein consists of many amino acids, some of which can be produced by the body.  Different foods contain different essential amino acids, some more than others.  Foods that contain all the essential amino acids are known as *complete* sources of protein.

Essentials amino acids are; ([Source, Amino Acids Guide](http://www.aminoacidsguide.com/));

| Amino Acid    | Role  |
| ------------- | ----- |
| Isoleucine    | Boosts energy levels and reduces recovery time |
| Leucine       | Helps regulate blood sugar levels |
| Histidine     | Helps with utilization of trace elements |
| Valine        | Prevents breakdown of muscle |
| Lysine        | Used for calcium absorption |
| Methionine    | Helps clean the liver |
| Phenylalanine | Used for the creation of adrenaline |
| Threonine     | Promotes metabolism |
| Tryptophan    | Building blocks of protein and various chemicals |

Complete sources of protein include; meat, fish, dairy, and eggs.

### Fat
Fat is essential to your health and wellbeing, due to the wide range of functions within the body.  Fat is a [source of energy, helps regulate body temperature, and absorbs nutrients](http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/three-functions-fat-body-3402.html).

On keto, when carbs are not available, fat is the primary fuel source, your main source of energy.  Fat has more than twice as many calories as carbs and protein (9 calories per gram for fat, compared to 4g per gram of carbs or protein).

When more fat is consumed than is needed, it is stored as [subcutaneous belly fat or visceral fat](https://draxe.com/visceral-fat/) (deep fat).  On keto, stored fat can be accessed more easily due to reduced blood sugar levels and decreased insulin sensitivity, meaning it can be used during periods of fasting or when calorie intake is lower.

Fat acts as insulation for your body, helping you maintain a normal core body temperature.  Normal temperature is about 36.5-37.5 °C (97.7-99.5 °F).

There are varying opinions on what types of fats are considered to be *"healthy"* and which are not.

* Polyunsaturated fat - Found in nuts, seeds, seed oils and oysters
* Monounsaturated fat - Found in nuts, avocados and vegetable oils
* Saturated fat - Red meat, poultry, lard and cream, butter.

Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats are considered a healthier option, and saturated fats are considered more dangerous by most scientists.  This is because saturated fat is solid at room temperature (think butter stored in your cupboard!), which scientists believe can lead to increased cholesterol, which could lead to heart disease, heart attack and atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries).  [Source](https://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/1124.aspx?categoryid=51).

There is, however, [evidence starting to emerge](http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/51/15/1111) that saturated fats are not as unhealthy as first feared.

Our advice is to get plenty variety in your diet and not shy away from saturated fat in moderation.

Fat soluble vitamins (Vitamin A, D, E, and K) are absorbed by fat rather than by water.  Fat soluble vitamins can only be absorbed when consumed with food, and you may become deficient if there is not enough fat in your diet.

### Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids
Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, also known as polyunsaturated fats, play an important role in human cell membranes (a layer of protection for the cell which also controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell).  Learn more about [Omega 3 & 6 fatty acids](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/omega-3-6-9-overview).

### Water
Water is essential to almost all functions within the body and must be consumed on a regular basis to prevent dehydration, illness and death.  Humans can live for around 3 weeks without food, but will die after 3 days without water.

It is recommended to consume around [6-8 glasses of water per day](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/tc/drinking-enough-water-topic-overview#1-3), although this will vary depending on your gender, age, body composition, activity levels, and your climate.

### Vitamins
Vitamins play a wide role in bodily function.

Essential vitamins are as follows;

| Vitamin | Water or fat soluble?  | Role  |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ----- |
| A       | Fat                    | Helps maintain vision and skin |
| C       | Water                  | Body connective tissue and antioxidant |
| D       | Fat                    | Absorption of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate |
| E       | Fat                    | Helps with function of many organs, enzymes and neurological processes |
| K       | Fat                    | Helps with blood clotting, helping heal wounds |
| B1 - Thiamin | Water             | Helps break down and release energy from food |
| B2 - Riboflavin | Water          | Keeps skin, eyes and the nervous system healthy |
| B3 - Niacin | Water              | Keeps skin, eyes and the nervous system healthy |
| B5 - Pantothenic Acid | Water    | Helps with protein systhesis and metabolism |
| B7 - Biotin | Water              | Helps break down fat |
| B12 - Cobalamin | Water          | Helps the body to use folic acid |
| Folate (Folic Acid) | Water      | Helps to form healthy red blood cells |

### Minerals
Minerals play a similar role in the body to Vitamins, but are fundamentally different.  Vitamins are organic, whereas minerals are inorganic and have a definite chemical composition.

| Mineral     | Role              |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| Sodium      | Maintains body fluid balance |
| Potassium, Chloride, Phosphorous, Magnesium | Electrolytes which contributes to health of the body's cells, tissues and organs |
| Iron        | Essential for blood production |
| Calcium     | Used to maintain and repair bones and teeth |
| Trace minerals  | Various functions essential for survival |

Minerals are found in non-living things, such as; water, rocks, soil, as well as in plants and animals.

If you ensure that you eat a range of healthy sources of meat, vegetables and dairy you should be able to satisfy most of your vitamin and mineral needs.  However, consider using a multivitamin supplement if you are concerned about being deficient.

## What are the benefits of good nutrition?
Eating well, which is getting the nutrition your body needs, can lead to;

### Higher energy levels
You may find yourself having increased energy levels, because your body has everything it needs to function effectively.  Even if you have never really exercised before, you may find yourself becoming more active (which in turn will help accelerate weight loss, if that is your goal).

### Better sleep
Being more active naturally helps improve sleep (you will feel more tired because of increased physical exhertion).  Also, being more active reduces the stress inducing hormone cortisol, which will also translate to more REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, and more deep sleep.

### Better mental focus
When eating a more complete diet, most people find that they can concentrate for longer periods of time, be more thoughtful, and have a sharper mind (reduced brain fog).  All these mental gains could lead to better performance in all aspects of your life.

## Standard nutritional guidelines
We have discussed food from a technical point of view so far, but we have not discussed what good nutrition looks like in a practical sense.

You are probably aware that we are in the midst of a global obesity epidemic (as discussed in the previous post).  You might not know though, however, that the start of the epidemic can be traced back to a single point of origin; the introduction of nutritional guidelines by the US Government that recommended basing meals around starchy foods like potatoes and rice.  These guidelines came from **Dietary Goals for the United States**, also known as the [McGovern report](http://zerodisease.com/archive/Dietary_Goals_For_The_United_States.pdf), published in 1977.

## What are the existing nutritional guidelines?
The nutritional guidelines for most western countries are roughly the same, consisting of starchy carbohydrates, meat, fish, fruit and nuts.

Here is a breakdown of the recommended diet for an adult.

### Eat 5 portions of fruit and vegetables per day.
Fruit is recommended because it is high in fiber, and contains essential and nonessential macro and micronutrients.  Fruit is seen as a healthier alternative to sugary manufactured snacks.  However, fruit is also full of naturally occurring fructose, which is a form of sugar.

It is possible to become overweight or obese purely from overeating of fruit, for the same reasons as eating too much milk chocolate will make you overweight or obese.  For this reason, there is a common saying amongst keto'ers... *fruit is nature's candy*.

Vegetables often grow underground and can be loaded with starch, which is a also a form of carbohydrate.  The vegetable functions to provide energy to the plant for sustenance when other energy sources of not available or sufficient to sustain it.

Nutritional guidelines recommend that starchy foods make up over 1/3 of everything we eat and that starchy foods should form the basis of all our meals.

**Did you know** that whilst most people consider potatoes to be healthy, they are not considered 1 of your 5 servings of vegetables per day, due to the high starch content.

### Eat low fat milk and dairy.
The nutritional guidelines state that when you consume dairy, you should choose low fat versions.

When you remove the fat from dairy, it is replaced with sugar, in the form of lactose.  Lactose is a naturally occurring sugar found in most milk based products.

### Meat & fish
Similar to the recommendation on dairy, the nutritional guidelines advise choosing lower fat, leaner cuts of meat.  They also recommend taking steps to reduce the fat content, when possible, even further.  In the case of chicken, the guidelines specifically state that you should remove the skin from chicken to reduce the overall fat content.

In the USA, sources of fish such as Salmon are considered *unhealthy*, because of their high fat content.  Also there is an implication that you should avoid canned or smoked fish entirely, because those products contain higher levels of salt.  [Source](https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/Healthyeating.aspx).

There are also recommendations from the World Health Organisation (WHO) that state you should limit your intake of red meat (such as beef) to a maximum of 1-2 times per week, and avoid processed meats such as bacon, because of a higher risk of developing heart disease.

<figcaption>Eat plenty of red meat</figcaption>
</figure>

### Eggs, nuts, beans and seeds
These food groups are higher in fat, so only consume in moderation.

The guidelines are very clear on avoiding saturated fat, and recommend to consume foods higher in unsaturated fat instead.  Foods high in unsaturated fat include; nuts, avocado, peanut butter, vegetable oil based products (margarine), sardines, seeds, salmon, vegetable oils, and flax seeds.

## Do you require more salt on the ketogenic diet?
Generally yes, mainly because processed *normal* foods (like bread, breakfast cereal, soup, beans and even sweet foods like biscuits) often contain a lot of added salt.  When eating keto you tend to eat foods that are naturally lower in salt, like; dairy, fatty cuts of meat, nuts, fresh vegetables etc.

You may choose to add salt to your meals to ensure that your bodily needs are satisfied.  [Sodium is important for hydration](https://www.ketovangelist.com/salt-the-prize-jewel-of-keto/), and maintaining the overall fluid levels in your body.

### What is the recommended amount of salt for an average adult per day?
According to the British National Health Service (NHS) the recommended intake of salt for an adult is 6g (which is roughly a big teaspoon).  They [say this is to reduce the risk of high blood pressure](https://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/1138.aspx?CategoryID=51).  However, according to popular book "[The Salt Fix](http://thesaltfix.com/)" by Dr James DiNicolantonio, a leading cardiovascular research scientist, we may not be consuming enough salt, and infact a lack of salt could be dangerous for our health.

The book suggests that not consuming enough salt can lead to more intense sugar cravings, weight gain, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, increased blood pressure and heart rate.

Our recommendation is to experiment with adding more salt to your diet and observe the results, listen to your body, and adjust according.  Eat more salt, 2-3 teaspoons per day, when fasting and on days where you undergo intense physical exercise (salt and other minerals are lost through sweat) and when you urinate frequently (say from over consumption of water or diuretics like tea/coffee).

## The importance of staying well hydrated on keto
Carbohydrate foods are typically loaded with salt as well as sugar.  When we switch to a ketogenic diet, we naturally consume less salt.  Cheese, dairy, meat, vegetables, etc are all typically low in salt.  Also, sugar is hydrophilic, which means that it absorbs water so water is retained in the body.  As we're cutting out sugar as well, then this is another source of retained water lost.

Salt is one electrolyte, similar to potassium and magnesium.  These are essential for our bodies to work properly, so it is important that we get plenty in our diet.

During your first weeks of keto, a significant amount of stored water may be lost (this is why you rapidly lose weight at first).  Consume plenty of water every day to avoid headaches, lightheadedness and fatigue.  Add quality sources of salt (like Pink Himalayan salt or celtic salt) to your diet to help with water retention.

A word about hydration.  Drinking not enough water OR too much water in a short space of time can result in DEATH.  As most people are in the middle of these two extremes you should not have much to worry about.  However, pay attention to the colour of your urine when visiting the bathroom.  [The optimium color of your urine](https://www.healthline.com/health/bright-yellow-urine) should be a pale yellow color.  Should your urine be a darker yellow, or orange, you should increase the amount of water you drink during the course of the day.  Should your urine be clear, you're probably drinking too much.  Try experimenting with your water intake.  Every time you urinate you lose essential minerals/electrolytes.

## How to deal with a cheat day.
In order for a short term diet to become a long term lifestyle change, it must be sustainable.  If you do not allow yourself any flexibility, aka a cheat day, then you are ultimately setting yourself up for failure.

It is ok to take a break from keto from time to time.  With this said however, you must keep a few things in mind;

* When starting out, we recommend an initial 3 month commitment with no cheat days.
  * This is because it takes time, 1-6 weeks for your body to start adequately producing (and utilising) ketones.
  * It is easier for your body to utilise carbs (simple sugars for energy).  If you consume more than your tolerance of carbs (say 20g net) in a single day, your body will revert to using this as its primary fuel source, and it takes up to several days to get back into ketosis.
  * When starting out, your body does not have the correct enzymes available to start utilizing fat for energy, this is partially why you get keto flu. Any introduction of carbs will stop the production of these enzymes and make it take longer to get into ketosis later.
* We recommend that if you are going to have a cheat day, then make the most of it, enjoy it, do not feel guilty.  Once you have had your fill, get back on the keto horse as soon as possible, preferably the next day.  The longer you delay the higher the risk that you will abandon the diet altogether.
* Once you have been keto adapted for a while without a break, then take a break, you should be able to get back into ketosis with 48-96 hours.

Remember, the ketogenic diet is a diet for life, a lifestyle change.  For a diet to be sustainable over a long period of time it must be flexible and forgiving when you stray away from it.

## Summary
The human body is a complex organic machine with significant energy requirements.  Energy is sourced from food, and what you eat has a direct impact on your health and wellbeing.  The body requires essential macro/micronutrients which it cannot produce itself, and that must come from food.  When eating keto, it is common to experience dehydration, so you should consume more water and add more salt to your diet.  Eating well can lead to; higher energy levels, better sleep and better mental focus.  Whilst we do not generally recommend a cheat day, it is possible as long as you follow some simple rules, such as; become keto adapted first, get back to eating keto as soon as possible, and be patient as it can take as long as 96 hours to switch back to using ketones for fuel.
