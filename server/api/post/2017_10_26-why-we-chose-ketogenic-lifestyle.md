I have always been **slim**.  I never struggled with weight gain so I must just be one of the lucky ones, or so I thought.

Growing up, the kids called me **twiggy** because I was so small compared to everyone else.  I had a fast metabolism, meaning I could eat what I wanted when I wanted, and not gain weight.

Jon was the same, he was able to eat everything and anything with no adverse affects on his weight.  Once we hit our late teens,  age 18-19 years, our body's changed although we did not even realise it until years later when we looked back at old family photos.

This was when we first decided to take action.  We were never going to let this happen again.

### Parenthood

Our main motivation to loose weight and get in shape came about when we learnt we were going to become parents.

We decided we were going to eat healthily to set a good example for our child.  The food we eat today is very different to what we used to understand as "healthy eating".

It was "known" that **you are what you eat**.  Eat fat, get fat.  Fat was bad and must be avoided.

Everything we ate was **high carb, high protein, and low fat**.  To us, it was normal to feel **bloated** after eating, hunger was a constant problem, and satiation was impossible.

This way of eating often lead to **binge** eating, and mild periods of **depression** and **anxiety**.

### Insanity

We completed the **Full 60 day Insanity Workout Program** and followed the meal plan with no slips, no mistakes, no errors.  This was a life changing commitment and we took it very seriously.

It is fair to say that we did not enjoy the food, but we were so determined to make the change that we started a new rule, **you eat it, or starve**.  Thankfully we never had to literally starve, but this rule sufficiently motivated us to go on.

We had a love/hate relationship with **Insanity**.  The training was insane, the food was insane, but the results were insane.  We both lost a massive amount of weight.  Jon lost almost 3 stone (42lbs) and I lost around 1 stone (14lbs).  We were both **exstatic with the results**.

However, Insanity failed to give us the lifestyle change we were looking for, and we **quickly fell off the wagon**, and regained all the weight we lost during this time.

### What now?

We needed to find a diet where I did not have to exercise and still maintain a good healthy weight for my age and height.

Jon heard about the ketogenic diet through reading, and from listening to podcasts where the subject was mentioned.  After a while, Jon did some research, read the science, started following the ketogenic community, and starting considering experimenting with this revolutionary way of living.

At first we thought the ketogenic diet was a revised version of the **Atkins diet**.  Whilst this is partially true, we liked the fact that there was a strong focus on eating lots of leafy green vegetables, some root vegetables, and generally the fact that there is a wider variety of food available to us.

It is true that at first we were both *very* sceptical of keto because it really laughs in the face of conventional wisdom.  During our whole lives we have been convinced by governments, healthcare bodies, charities, big business, and even our families that **fat is good for you and carbs are bad**.

But, one crazy night, we decided to make a commitment and give it a try.

### How keto changed us as a family

We chose keto because we want to be healthy, happy, free of illness and disease (as much as possible), to reduce brain fog, to improve our concentration and performance, to build muscle, to improve our cardiovascular health, and, most importantly to eliminate hunger from our lives.

We have achieved our goals, now we want to **help others** make the same level of change in their lives.
