  "instructions": [
    "To make brazil & precan flour, blend both bags of nuts in a food processor and put this to one side.",

    "Microwave for 1 min, stir and then another 30 sec, stir (very hot!)",
    "Stir in egg & flour.",

    "Dock (poke rows of holes) with a fork to avoid bubbling.",
    "Sprinkle with garlic salt",
    "Put in 425 degree oven. After about 8 minutes, check it and poke holes where any large bubbles may be.",
    "Continue cooking for a total 12-14 min, or until slightly brown on top.",
    "Add the salsa for the sauce",
    "Add cheese slices for the topping",
